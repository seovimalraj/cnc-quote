Dead Code Audit - apps/web/app
Date: November 14, 2025
Audited Directory: apps/web/app
Summary
This audit identified backup files, duplicate routes, and potentially unused code in the application directory that should be reviewed and cleaned up.
1. Backup Files (DELETE IMMEDIATELY)
These files should never be in version control - Git handles versioning:
 apps/web/app/admin/review/page.tsx.bak
 apps/web/app/dfm-analysis/[id]/page.tsx.backup
 apps/web/app/dfm-analysis/[id]/page.tsx.backup2
 apps/web/app/instant-quote/page.tsx.working
Action: Delete all backup files immediately.
2. Duplicate Dashboard Routes
Two separate dashboard implementations exist:
Option A: Standalone Dashboard
Path: apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx
Features: Mock data, customer layout, basic stats
Status: Appears to be a demo/placeholder
Option B: Portal Dashboard
Path: apps/web/app/portal/dashboard/page.tsx
Features: More complete UI, recent quotes/orders, better styling
Status: Appears to be the main implementation
Issue: Having both creates confusion about which is the canonical dashboard.
Recommendation:
Keep /portal/dashboard as the main customer dashboard
Either delete /dashboard or redirect it to /portal/dashboard
3. Quote Route Confusion
Multiple quote-related routes that may overlap:
/quote/[id]/ - Quote detail page
/quotes/[id]/ - Quote detail page (duplicate?)
/get-quote/ - Quote creation
/instant-quote/ - Instant quote flow
/instant-quote-v2/ - Newer version?
/quote-config/[id]/ - Quote configuration
/(quote)/pricing-demo/ - Demo route
Issues:
/quote/[id] vs /quotes/[id] - Which is canonical?
instant-quote vs instant-quote-v2 - Is v1 deprecated?
pricing-demo - Should this be in production?
Recommendations:
1. Standardize on either /quote/[id] or /quotes/[id]
2. If instant-quote-v2 is current, remove or redirect instant-quote
3. Remove pricing-demo from production builds
4. Duplicate Checkout Routes
Two checkout implementations:
/checkout/[quoteId]/
/secure-checkout/[quoteId]/
Issue: Unclear which is the active checkout flow.
Recommendation: Consolidate to one checkout route, redirect the other.
5. Potentially Unused/Incomplete Features
Recommendation System
apps/web/app/recommendation/ - Contains utility files but no page routes
Files: apply-recommendation.ts , recommendation-banner.tsx , etc.
Status: May be component library, not dead code
Operations Routes
apps/web/app/(ops)/capacity/
apps/web/app/(ops)/orders/
apps/web/app/(ops)/routing/
apps/web/app/(ops)/suppliers/
Question: Are these duplicates of admin routes or separate features?
Demo/Test Routes
/(quote)/pricing-demo/ - Demo route
Recommendation: Remove from production or gate behind feature flag
6. Admin Route Duplication
Potential overlap between admin and ops routes:
/admin/orders/ vs /(ops)/orders/
/admin/capacity/ vs /(ops)/capacity/
/admin/suppliers/ vs /(ops)/suppliers/
Recommendation: Audit if these serve different purposes or are duplicates.
7. Auth Route Variations
Multiple auth-related routes:
/(auth)/signin/
/(auth)/sign-up/
/api/auth/signin/
/api/auth/login/
/api/auth/register/
Note: API routes vs page routes are expected, but verify /login vs /signin consistency.
Action Items
High Priority (Do Now)
1.  Delete all .bak , .backup , .backup2 , .working files
2.  Choose one dashboard route and redirect/remove the other
3.  Consolidate quote detail routes ( /quote/[id] vs /quotes/[id] )
4.  Remove or redirect deprecated instant-quote version
Medium Priority (This Sprint)
5. ⚠ Consolidate checkout routes
6. ⚠ Remove or feature-flag demo routes
7. ⚠ Audit admin vs ops route overlap
Low Priority (Technical Debt)
8.  Document which routes are canonical
9.  Add redirects for deprecated routes
10.  Create route naming conventions
Files to Delete
# Backup files
rm apps/web/app/admin/review/page.tsx.bak
rm apps/web/app/dfm-analysis/[id]/page.tsx.backup
rm apps/web/app/dfm-analysis/[id]/page.tsx.backup2
rm apps/web/app/instant-quote/page.tsx.working
Notes
This audit focused on structural issues, not code quality
Some "duplicates" may serve different user roles (customer vs admin)
Route groups like (auth) , (dash) , etc. are Next.js conventions and are fine
The /api directory was not deeply audited but may have similar issues
Next Steps
1. Review this document with the team
2. Make decisions on which routes to keep
3. Create tickets for cleanup work
4. Update routing documentation
5. Add linting rules to prevent backup files in commits
