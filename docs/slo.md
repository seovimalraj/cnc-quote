# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the CNC Quote platform. These metrics help us measure and maintain service reliability.

## Availability

- **API Uptime**: 99.9% (monthly)
  - Maximum allowed downtime: 43.8 minutes/month
  - Measured via health check endpoints
  - Monitored through Sentry & custom monitoring

- **Widget Availability**: 99.95% (monthly)
  - Maximum allowed downtime: 21.9 minutes/month
  - Measured by successful widget loads
  - Monitored through PostHog & Sentry

## Latency

- **API Response Time**:
  - 95th percentile: < 500ms
  - 99th percentile: < 1000ms
  - Excludes CAD processing operations
  - Monitored through Sentry performance metrics

- **Widget Load Time**:
  - 90th percentile: < 2s initial load
  - 95th percentile: < 3s initial load
  - Measured through PostHog & browser performance metrics

## CAD Processing

- **File Analysis Time**:
  - 90th percentile: < 30s for files < 50MB
  - 95th percentile: < 60s for files < 50MB
  - Monitored through custom metrics

- **Success Rate**:
  - 95% successful processing for valid CAD files
  - Monitored through PostHog & custom metrics

## Quote Generation

- **Quote Creation Time**:
  - 90th percentile: < 5s after CAD analysis
  - 95th percentile: < 10s after CAD analysis
  - Monitored through PostHog & custom metrics

- **Accuracy**:
  - < 1% quote generation errors
  - Monitored through error tracking & manual reviews

## Error Rates

- **API Error Rate**: < 0.1% of requests
- **Widget Error Rate**: < 0.5% of sessions
- **DFM Analysis Failures**: < 5% of valid files
- **Payment Processing Errors**: < 0.1% of transactions

## Data Persistence

- **Backup Success Rate**: 100% daily backups
- **Backup Retention**: 30 days of daily backups
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 24 hours

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Metrics Collection**:
  - API performance metrics: 1-minute intervals
  - Error tracking: Real-time via Sentry
  - User behavior: Real-time via PostHog

- **Alert Response**:
  - Critical alerts: < 15 minutes response time
  - High priority: < 1 hour response time
  - Medium priority: < 4 hours response time

## Improvement Targets

- Reduce 95th percentile API latency to < 300ms
- Improve widget load time to < 1.5s for 90th percentile
- Decrease CAD processing time by 20%
- Implement automated failover for critical services
- Achieve 99.99% uptime for core API endpoints
